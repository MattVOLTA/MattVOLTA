Builder and CEO at Volta, an AI startup incubator in Atlantic Canada. Focused on helping ambitious founders build AI-first software companies by emphasizing execution, experimentation, and skill-building over theory.

I work at the intersection of community, product, and data, shaping programs like the Impact OS and the Volta Builders Network to create evidence-based support systems for founders and incubators.

Passionate about connecting fragmented ecosystems, I invest in building infrastructure—tools, events, and frameworks—that give entrepreneurs clarity, discipline, and the capacity to scale. Always learning, always iterating.
